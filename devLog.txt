What I would like my app to do...
I would like to have Monday-Friday cards be up on the home page on page load.
I would like the user to be able to click on the exercise button associated with that day.
When the button is clicked I would like a pop up to appear that has the 5 work outs associated 
with that day to appear.
The user should be able to input how many reps they were able to accomplish.
At the bottom there should be a save button and a reset button so they can save there
reps or reset if they need to change them.
I would also like to have the user be able to favorite a program so they can go back and
see which ones they liked.



Steps to implement my app---------------------
1- I set up vite express
2- created a models folder and created all my tables and there foreign keys
3- created a seed folder that holds my table data
4- create end points that I need for my user
5- 



TO DO:-----------------------
get a basic component tree nailed down
think of what end points i need
think of queries I need to get my data from my tables
